# Problems

This was supposed to be my first multiplayer game, but when I wanted to switch from a bean to a humanoid character, the problems began. There were a lot of them, and the final strike hit when everything was synchronized across the network. Out of nowhere, the characters weren't in the same location anymore after turning on the animations for the characters.
